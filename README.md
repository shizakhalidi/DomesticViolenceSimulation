# Domestic Violence Simulation

The purpose of the ABM is to simulate the relationship between a husband and wife, and use
this simulation to explain the various factors that lead to domestic violence, particularly abuse
of the wife by the husband.
Another purpose of the model is to educate the general public. Intimate partner violence is one
of the most predominant social issues. Especially in places like Karachi, people from all sorts of
socio-economic backgrounds are affected by it. We would like this model to become a basis for
providing public awareness about the factors that lead to intimate partner violence, and how
small actions can create a severe impact on a coupleâ€™s relationship in the long run.
